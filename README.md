## Video-Games Development Passionate

### Having Blender and Unreal Engine running simultaneously hits harder than 124 mg. of Fent.

#### Blender Villain Ark
> With more than 500h in Blender, I can create simple or highly detailed 3d Meshes with not so good topologies. I started with animating meshes pirated from Russian websites, SketchFab and CGTrader. To compensate for my basic knowledge in rigging, I focus to create lively animations that transmit the right emotions. Knowledge in human and non-human anatomy also helps.

#### Unreal Engine Hero Ark
> I started my first game dev project in UE4, at the age of 16. It was a 2d platformer where a barbaric man had to dodge crossbow arrows and climb a SnoopDog.png. Sadly, I do not have the project saved anymore.

> With the launch of Unreal Engine 5, I started playing around with random projects, some more serious than others. My most beloved are:
>
> - Project A <br>
> Genre: Casual, Adventure <br>
> Change between Finn and Jake, and walk around the tree house. <br>
>
> - Project B <br>
> Genre: Action, Shooter <br>
> Inspired from Attack on Titan, I played with coding grapple hooks, air movement, and fun weapons. <br>
>
> - Project C <br>
> Genre: Horror, Story <br>
> The player is trapped in a communist appartment building and weird things happen. Careful for the train rails in the hallway, a train will rush! Inside the bathroom, don't fight the microwaveman. When you exit the building watch out for giraffes with baby doll heads. <br>
>
> -Project D <br>
> Genre: Horror, Post Apocalypse, CO-OP
> Drive around the post apocalyptic world in your high tech truck and deliver O2 to the bunkers sheltering the last human lives. You will always be followed by the monster Blade Runner across the whole map  and also find anothers.
