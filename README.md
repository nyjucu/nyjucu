## Video-Games Development Passionate

### Having Blender and Unreal Engine running simultaneously hits harder than 124 mg. of Fent.

#### Blender Villain Ark
> With more than 400h in Blender, I can create simple or complex, highly detailed 3d Meshes with horrible topologies. I started with animating meshes pirated from Russian websites, SketchFab and CGTrader. To compensate for my basic knowledge in rigging, I focus to create lively animations that transmit the right emotions. Knowledge in human and non-human anatomy also helps me a lot. My favourite tip is exagerating the right movements.

#### Unreal Engine Hero Ark
> I started my first game dev project in UE4, at the age of 16. It was a 2d platformer where a barbaric man had to dodge crossbow arrows and climb a SnoopDog.png. Sadly, I do not have the project saved anymore.

> With the launch of Unreal Engine 5, I started playing around with random projects, some more serious than others. My most beloved are:
>
> - Adventure Time <br>
> Genre: Casual, Adventure <br>
> Change between Finn and Jake, and walk around the tree house. <br>
>
> - Call of The Winds <br>
> Genre: Action, Shooter <br>
> Chibby? That's too cute for an Attack on Titan inspired game. Americanize it! Add some guns, make it fun. <br>
>
> - Escape the Regime <br>
> Genre: Horror, Story <br>
> The player is trapped in a communist appartment building and weird things happen. Careful for the train rails in the hallway, a train will rush! Inside the bathroom, don't fight the microwaveman. When you exit the building watch out for giraffes with baby doll heads. <br>
